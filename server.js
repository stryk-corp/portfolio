/*
 This file previously contained a Node/Express+Nodemailer prototype used during development.
 It has been intentionally removed to avoid committing runnable server code or secrets.

 This repository is configured to use Cloudflare Pages Forms (native POST) to capture contact
 submissions and route them via Cloudflare Pages' integrations or dashboard notifications.

 If you require a self-hosted contact endpoint, create a new secure service outside this repo
 and keep credentials out of source control (use environment variables and a private deployment).
